# Introduction to Rancher: On-prem Kubernetes

This guide follows the general instructions of running a [manual rancher install](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/quick-start-guide/deployment/quickstart-manual-setup/) and running our own infrastructure on Hyper-v

# Hyper-V : Prepare our infrastructure

In this demo, we will use Hyper-V to create our infrastructure.  </br>
For on-premise, many companies use either Hyper-V, VMWare Vsphere and other technologies to create virtual infrastructure on bare metal. </br>

Few points to note here:

* Benefit of Virtual infrastructure is that it's immutable
  a) We can add and throw away virtual machines at will.
  b) This makes maintenance easier as we can roll updated virtual machines instead of 
     patching existing machines and turning them to long-living snowflakes.
  c) Reduce lifespan of machines

* Bare Metal provides the compute. 
  a) We don't want Kubernetes directly on bare metal as we want machines to be immutable.
  b) This goes back to the previous point on immutability.

* Every virtual machine needs to be able to reach each other on the network
  a) This is a kubernetes networking requirements that all nodes can communicate with one another

# Hyper-V : Create our network

In order for us to create virtual machines all on the same network, I am going to create a virtual switch in Hyper-v </br>
Open Powershell in administrator

```
# get our network adapter where all virtual machines will run on
# grab the name we want to use
Get-NetAdapter

Import-Module Hyper-V
$ethernet = Get-NetAdapter -Name "Ethernet 2"
New-VMSwitch -Name "virtual-network" -NetAdapterName $ethernet.Name -AllowManagementOS $true -Notes "shared virtual network interface"
```

# Hyper-V : Create our machines

We firstly need harddrives for every VM. </br>
Let's create three:

```
mkdir c:\temp\vms\linux-0\
mkdir c:\temp\vms\linux-1\
mkdir c:\temp\vms\linux-2\

New-VHD -Path c:\temp\vms\linux-0\linux-0.vhdx -SizeBytes 20GB
New-VHD -Path c:\temp\vms\linux-1\linux-1.vhdx -SizeBytes 20GB
New-VHD -Path c:\temp\vms\linux-2\linux-2.vhdx -SizeBytes 20GB
```

```
New-VM `
-Name "linux-0" `
-Generation 1 `
-MemoryStartupBytes 2048MB `
-SwitchName "virtual-network" `
-VHDPath "c:\temp\vms\linux-0\linux-0.vhdx" `
-Path "c:\temp\vms\linux-0\"

New-VM `
-Name "linux-1" `
-Generation 1 `
-MemoryStartupBytes 2048MB `
-SwitchName "virtual-network" `
-VHDPath "c:\temp\vms\linux-1\linux-1.vhdx" `
-Path "c:\temp\vms\linux-1\"

New-VM `
-Name "linux-2" `
-Generation 1 `
-MemoryStartupBytes 2048MB `
-SwitchName "virtual-network" `
-VHDPath "c:\temp\vms\linux-2\linux-2.vhdx" `
-Path "c:\temp\vms\linux-2\"

```

Setup a DVD drive that holds the `iso` file for Ubuntu Server

```
Set-VMDvdDrive -VMName "linux-0" -ControllerNumber 1 -Path "C:\temp\ubuntu-20.04.3-live-server-amd64.iso"
Set-VMDvdDrive -VMName "linux-1" -ControllerNumber 1 -Path "C:\temp\ubuntu-20.04.3-live-server-amd64.iso"
Set-VMDvdDrive -VMName "linux-2" -ControllerNumber 1 -Path "C:\temp\ubuntu-20.04.3-live-server-amd64.iso"
```

Start our VM's

```
Start-VM -Name "linux-0"
Start-VM -Name "linux-1"
Start-VM -Name "linux-2"
```

Now we can open up Hyper-v Manager and see our infrastructure. </br>
In this video we'll connect to each server, and run through the initial ubuntu setup. </br>
Once finished, select the option to reboot and once it starts, you will notice an `unmount` error on CD-Rom </br>
This is ok, just shut down the server and start it up again.

# Hyper-V : Setup SSH for our machines

Now in this demo, because I need to copy rancher bootstrap commands to each VM, it would be easier to do so
using SSH. So let's connect to each VM in Hyper-V and setup SSH. </br>
This is because `copy+paste` does not work without `Enhanced Session` mode in Ubuntu Server. </br>

Let's temporarily turn on SSH on each server:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y nano net-tools openssh-server
sudo systemctl enable ssh
sudo ufw allow ssh
sudo systemctl start ssh
```

Record the IP address of each VM so we can SSH to it:

```
sudo ifconfig
# record eth0
linux-0 IP=192.168.0.16
linux-1 IP=192.168.0.17
linux-2 IP=192.168.0.18
```

In new Powershell windows, let's SSH to our VMs

```
ssh linux-0@192.168.0.16
ssh linux-1@192.168.0.17
ssh linux-2@192.168.0.18
```

# Setup Docker

It is required that every machine that needs to join our cluster, has docker running on it. </br>
Firstly, rancher will use docker to run it's agent as well as bootstrap the cluster.</br>

Install docker on each VM:
```
curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh
sudo usermod -aG docker $(whoami)
sudo service docker start
```

# Running Rancher in Docker

So Rancher can be [deployed](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/quick-start-guide/deployment/) almost anywhere. </br>
We can run it in Kubernetes on-prem or the cloud.  </br>

Now because we want Rancher to manage kubernetes clusters, we dont want it running in the clusters we are managing. </br>
So I would like to keep my Rancher server outside and separate from my Kubernetes clusters.</br>

So let's setup a single server with [docker](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/quick-start-guide/deployment/quickstart-manual-setup/)

## Persist data

We will want to persist ranchers data across reboots. </br>
Rancher stores its data under `/var/lib/rancher` </br> 

In this repo, let's create a space to persist data:

```
cd kubernetes/rancher
mkdir volume

```

## Run Rancher

```
docker run -d --name rancher-server  -v ${PWD}/volume:/var/lib/rancher --restart=unless-stopped -p 80:80 -p 443:443 --privileged rancher/rancher
```

## Unlock Rancher

Once its up and running we can extract the Rancher initial boostrap password from the logs 

```
docker logs rancher-server > rancher.log
```

## Get Rancher IP

It's important that our servers can reach the Rancher server. </br>
As all the VMs and my machine are on the same network, we can use my machine IP as the server IP so the VM's can reach it. </br>
let's grab the IP:

```
ipconfig
```

We can now access Rancher on [localhost](https://localhost)

## Deploy Sample Workloads

To deploy some sample basic workloads, let's get the `kubeconfig` for our cluster </br>

Set kubeconfig:

```
$ENV:KUBECONFIG="<path-to-kubeconfig>"
```

Deploy 2 pods, and a service:

```
kubectl create ns marcel
kubectl -n marcel apply -f .\kubernetes\configmaps\configmap.yaml
kubectl -n marcel apply -f .\kubernetes\secrets\secret.yaml
kubectl -n marcel apply -f .\kubernetes\deployments\deployment.yaml
kubectl -n marcel apply -f .\kubernetes\services\service.yaml
```

One caveat is because we are not a cloud provider, Kubernetes does not support our service `type=LoadBalancer`. </br>
For that, we need something like `metallb`. </br>
However - we can `port-forward`

```
kubectl -n marcel get svc 
NAME              TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
example-service   LoadBalancer   10.43.235.240   <pending>     80:31310/TCP   13s

kubectl -n marcel port-forward svc/example-service 81:80
```

We can access our example-app on port 81
